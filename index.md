I am currently a 2nd year Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Yan Liu][yan_liu].

I am interested in physics-informed machine learning, spatial-temporal data mining, geometric deep learning and graph neural networks.

My email address is `chuizhem AT usc DOT edu`.
